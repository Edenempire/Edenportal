<h1>OUR STORY</h1>
<span>[ EDEN CONGLOMERATE — ORIGIN ARCHIVE ]</span>
</div>

<div class="story">

<div class="block">
<h2>THE VISIONARY</h2>
<p>
It all began with Thato Morake — the founder.
Once there was a young boy named Thato who carried within him a global vision:
to build an empire. A boy with no limits in thinking, no mental constraints,
and absolutely no desire for anything small.
</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<h2>2023 — DIVINE ALIGNMENT</h2>
<p>
In 2023, while attending the Universal Church, Thato crossed paths with Philani Kemele.
Thato had long been part of the church community, but for Philani, 2023 was his first year.
At first, nothing significant stood between them.
Philani initially dismissed Thato as just another charmer boy who thinks the entire world revolves around him.
</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<h2>THE SOCCER CATALYST</h2>
<p>
When the church launched a soccer tournament, the young men began practicing regularly.
Philani had no interest in soccer at the time — his world revolved entirely around coding.
He lacked experience and didn’t want embarrassment.
But Thato and Mpumelelo convinced him to join.
That single practice session changed everything.
</p>
<p>
During games, between passes and tactical shifts, conversations unfolded —
about God, about manhood, about purpose.
With every word Thato spoke, Philani began to realize:
this was not just a talker. This was someone who thought like him.
</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<h2>THE LIBRARY MEETING — OCTOBER 2023</h2>
<p>
Around October 2023, Philani invited Thato to the Durban Central Municipal Library.
He wanted clarity — to confirm whether his intuition was correct.
The first meeting failed due to scheduling conflicts,
but the next day they sat down together.
</p>
<p>
Before business was discussed, they drew up soccer tactics —
ensuring they would win the tournament.
Then came the defining question.
</p>
<p>
“Where do you want to be in life?”
</p>
<p>
“The top,” Thato replied.
</p>
<p>
“Me too,” Philani said.
</p>
<p>
“How are we going to get there?”
</p>
<p>
“Through money.”
</p>
<p>
“And how do we get that money?”
</p>
<p>
“Business.”
</p>
<p>
Not small-time business.
Global-scale business.
</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<h2>THE STRATEGY BEGINS</h2>
<p>
From that moment forward, Eden was not an idea —
it was a direction.
They began strategizing, mapping futures,
calculating moves before they were ever made.
What started as a conversation in a library
became the foundation of Eden Conglomerate.
